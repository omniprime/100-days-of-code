# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Free Code Camp lessons on HTML.

**Thoughts:** I have done all that I went through today before. I am feeling very anxious over getting back into this for some reason. I hope it goes away as I go on.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made it through the CSS and Bootstrap lessons. Just hit jQuery

**Thoughts:** I wish Bootstrap was a thing when I was doing this 10 years ago. I did not have as much anxiety today, but had a little trouble focusing.
