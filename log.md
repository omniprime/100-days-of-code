# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Free Code Camp lessons on HTML.

**Thoughts:** I have done all that I went through today before. I am feeling very anxious over getting back into this for some reason. I hope it goes away as I go on.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made it through the CSS and Bootstrap lessons. Just hit jQuery

**Thoughts:** I wish Bootstrap was a thing when I was doing this 10 years ago. I did not have as much anxiety today, but had a little trouble focusing. 

### Day 3: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the beginnings of jQuery in FCC. Started a codepen account to get some work done quickly on the web.

**Thoughts:** Code Pen is pretty nice. No need to worry about some of the things like the "<head>" and "<body>" since it is built in for you.

### Day 4: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished my Tribute page. Most of the delay came from researching my person, but this come with the territory when all info is not provided by the client. Will have it done tomorrow early so I can move on to other things.

**Thoughts:** This first project on FCC is simple enough. I got stuck for a good 10 minutes when I could not center my "<div>'s". realized that I forgot to add bootstrap to the CSS on Codepen.

### Day 5: January 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the tribute page. Took me the whole hour.

**Thoughts:** Didn't think this would take me the whole hour to do. Hopefully the next project will not require as much research. I am also a bit frustrated that codepen does not allow the target="_blank" option to go to a link. Makes me think that my code does not work.

### Day 6: January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on my portfolio page project for FCC. I focused solely on the top navbar portion of the page.

**Thoughts:** I think I should have stepped away from the navbar about halfway through my hour. I started to get a little overcome by how much I do not know about bootstrap and spent a lot of time trying to figure it all out. I will be spending some more time going over bootstrap and some simple Javascript to hopefully understand it better.
