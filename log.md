# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Free Code Camp lessons on HTML.

**Thoughts:** I have done all that I went through today before. I am feeling very anxious over getting back into this for some reason. I hope it goes away as I go on.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made it through the CSS and Bootstrap lessons. Just hit jQuery

**Thoughts:** I wish Bootstrap was a thing when I was doing this 10 years ago. I did not have as much anxiety today, but had a little trouble focusing. 

### Day 3: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the beginnings of jQuery in FCC. Started a codepen account to get some work done quickly on the web.

**Thoughts:** Code Pen is pretty nice. No need to worry about some of the things like the "<head>" and "<body>" since it is built in for you.

### Day 4: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished my Tribute page. Most of the delay came from researching my person, but this come with the territory when all info is not provided by the client. Will have it done tomorrow early so I can move on to other things.

**Thoughts:** This first project on FCC is simple enough. I got stuck for a good 10 minutes when I could not center my "<div>'s". realized that I forgot to add bootstrap to the CSS on Codepen.

### Day 5: January 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the tribute page. Took me the whole hour.

**Thoughts:** Didn't think this would take me the whole hour to do. Hopefully the next project will not require as much research. I am also a bit frustrated that codepen does not allow the target="_blank" option to go to a link. Makes me think that my code does not work.

### Day 6: January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on my portfolio page project for FCC. I focused solely on the top navbar portion of the page.

**Thoughts:** I think I should have stepped away from the navbar about halfway through my hour. I started to get a little overcome by how much I do not know about bootstrap and spent a lot of time trying to figure it all out. I will be spending some more time going over bootstrap and some simple Javascript to hopefully understand it better.

### Day 7: January 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I added the three required sections of the portfolio page and threw in some random placeholder images and colors. It looks like a clown page right now, but it is progress.

**Thoughts:** I am taking the day off tomorrow and I think I will spend most of the day learning more HTML, CSS, and about bootstrap. I am so far removed that most of my time for programming is taken up by research.

### Day 8: January 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished my portfolio page for the time being. I added the required buttons, links and placeholder spots for what I have worked on. 

**Thoughts:** I spent over 5 hours working and researching today to get the page as it looks. I think it still needs a lot of tweaks, but for now it will serve it's purpose and will give me a chance to move onto JavaScript.

### Day 9: January 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working my way through FCC's JavaScript lessions. So far mostly things I remember.

**Thoughts:** I forgot how much trouble Arrays gave me. I think there is something I am missing when I try to think about multi-dimentional arrays. When they start to get bigger I sometimes have a hard time keeping track. Perhaps tomorrows challenges will explain it better.

### Day 10: January 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent half of my hour learning more JavaScript. I spent the other half working on my personal CSS.

**Thoughts:** I am trying to replace Bootstrap to some degree so I know more about what is going on with my page than just having to guess how some of thier things interact. I still have a hard time with positioning. I have a header and a main body in good places, but my footer is floating at the top right now. Will work more on it tomorrow.

### Day 11: January 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent half of my hour learning more JavaScript. I spent the other half working on my personal CSS.

**Thoughts:** Splitting the JavaScript lessions might not be the best choice. I had to go back a rereference some things from yesterday. Not the worst thing in the world, but took time away. I spent about 45 minutes on more CSS work. I still am having issues positioning items. I look forward to my week off of work so I might be able to spend more time learning and testing.

### Day 12: January 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: All Javascrip lessons today. High anxiety night.

**Thoughts:** I made it through 12 lessons on Javascript tonight. I had a very hard time focusing on the coding. I know everything I did was correct and I understood what I was doing, but for some reason I was very distracted tonight. I might not count this as a day and repeat 12 tomorrow in hopes that my anxiety and focus are back to normal levels.

### Day 13: January 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started with CSS. Moved into Javascript lessons when ran into more positioning issues.

**Thoughts:** I am having a lot of trouble positioning things with CSS. I need to find an indepth guide to make more sense of it. I would think that if I set a <div> nested in another <div> to a certain % position it would remain there and resize when the page shrinks, but it does not always do that. When I got a bit frustrated with that I moved on to more Javascript lessons and made some good progress with objects. I do wish that FCC spent more time on CSS early than just having us rely on bootstrap.

### Day 14: January 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: All JavaScript lessons today. Got stuck on a search function

**Thoughts:** Good progress through loops. Ended the hour on the profile lookup lession. Having an issue visualizing how it needs to search through the object to find the items it is looking for. Will try again tomorrow.

### Day 15: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic section of JavaScript on FCC.

**Thoughts:** I got a little frustrated with the search through a profile section because I forgot about the hasOwnProperty function from a couple of days earlier. I think I might want to try and spend a little more time experimenting on some of these lessions to help retain more.

### Day 16: January 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent the who time messing with my portfolio page to try and get it to a better place.

**Thoughts:** I learned a few things about bootstraps positioning. I am not a huge fan of their color choices, but I can change that later. The hour kind of escaped me. I might change it to 2 hours when I am free coding like this.

### Day 17: January 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Another hour with the portfolio page and bootstrap

**Thoughts:** I am having trouble trying to center images of different heights next to each other. I am not sure what is causing it yet. I think it may be because they are in an <ul> and that is making it follow certain rules. I might try and change those out for something else.

### Day 18: January 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some JavaScript lessons on FCC. Started getting into the open ended questions to help me learn better. 

**Thoughts:** I broke my browser by forcing an infinite loop that I missed. Was kind of funny because I did not see why it was infinite at first. Realized my while statement could never finish because I kept raising the number I was trying to compair to. Got it fixed before the end of the hour. Overall felt kind of slow tonight because of some anxiety. 

### Day 19: January 21st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Palimdrones. whole hour to compair two strings.

**Thoughts:** Took longer than I thought it would to compair two strings. Mostly came down to the missing [ ] around my [^A-Za-z0-9] to remove any non alphanumerical characters. I think it is a little dumb that there isn't a shortcut way to do this. \W is close, but it includes the _ so it could not be used in this case. Reversing the string was not too hard once I stopped to think about it.

### Day 20: January 22nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on finding the longest word in a string.

**Thoughts:** For some reason I was not able to get this to work over the hour I had today. I kept getting an undefined error when I was trying to get the length of one of my words. I will look more at it tomorrow.

### Day 21: January 23rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a couple more basic JavaScript algorithms on FCC.

**Thoughts:** Really confused why setting a variable to anything but 0 would hurt my code so much. 

### Day 22: January 24th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on more CSS and getting my portfolio page to where I want it.

**Thoughts:** Learned a good deal about @media for CSS. It is a helpful call when your site needs to look different on different devices.

### Day 23: January 25th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Messed with a little more CSS then worked on another couple of FCC Javascript algorithms

**Thoughts:** I still have a lot to learn about CSS and JavaScript. I also think that a couple of the algorithm requests on the FCC lessons are meant for you to get wrong the first time.

### Day 24: January 26th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript algorithms

**Thoughts:** I over think almost every request that I am tasked with. I need to slow down and simply map out the problem instead of overcomplicating it.

### Day 25: January 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript algorithms

**Thoughts:** Three left to go. I am having issues with this seek and destroy alogrithm. I am not following how to properly cut up an object that could have infinite arguments.

### Day 26: January 28th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Seek and Destroy

**Thoughts:** This algorithm kicked my ass. I have learned that I am having a difficult time following a function inside of a function like that filter() expects. The last one was not as bad since Boolean is easier to follow, but having to make a simple function inside of the call will take some getting used to.

### Day 27: January 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Javascripting basic algorithms and intro to JSON

**Thoughts:** Finished up the basic algorithms on FCC. Moved onto the first lession of JSON APIs and Ajax. The final alogrithm was not too bad. I would like it to work for all characters and not just capitals, but that might be something for me to mess with later. It might be nice to have a simple cipher for future notes so not everyone can read my notes.

### Day 28: January 30th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Messed with CSS Flexbox and worked on some Codeacademy javascript lessons

**Thoughts:** I do not feel like I have the proper grasp on JavaScript. I am going to go through the lessons on Codeacademy to hopefully suplement the lessons I learned going through the stuff with FCC. I will probably do this for a couple of days to get a furth understanding of how Javascript effects web sites and not just the behind the scenes things that I had to do with the basic algorithms.

### Day 29: January 31st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent the hour on Codewars for JavaScript

**Thoughts:** I think I suck with Javascript. I need to find a place to research it and go one item at a time instead of getting a problem and having to spend so much time researching what I could possibly do to solve it. I am going to spend tomorrow on Codeacademy again I think and see is that helps.

### Day 30: February 1st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent the time working on JavaScript on Codeacademy and a little of codewars

**Thoughts:** CodeAcademy has some annoying syntax requirements that I do not care for. Code with case 'blah' : is the same as case 'blah': The extra space between the case and the colon makes no difference when running the code. A little annoying. The stuff I am currently doing is pretty basice again, but I think I need to do it to get better.

### Day 31: February 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some CSS and took a look at jQuery

**Thoughts:** I think I have a pretty good grasp on the basics of CSS. I just need to get into some futher manipulations that I think will come as I work with more javaScript. I deceided to take a look at jQuery today to see if that might help with some of the troubles I am having with main javascript. So far I wish I had done this sooner. It seems to be a lot easier to understand. I have only just scratched the surface of it, but I do wish that this was how javascript was originally designed.

### Day 32: February 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: jQuery animations and direct changes to CSS and HTML elements

**Thoughts:** Felt ill today. Only did 30 minutes of actual work. Going to make up the 30 minutes tomorrow when feeling better. Learned a good amount of basic jQuery and got a good understanding of selectors and chaining code.

### Day 33: February 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: jQuery, CSS, and Quote generation page

**Thoughts:** Made a ton of progress on the FCC Quote generator. I just have to make it look pretty now. Learned a ton about CSS flex and jQuery animations and changing HTML elements. Had a good 2 hours of it today. Didn't want to stop.

### Day 34: February 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FCC Quote generator

**Thoughts:** I spent the hour working on my quote generator. I was finally able to get the contents of the container to be centered using flexbox. It works pretty well. I will keep experimenting with it. The only thing I have left is to get it to post to Twitter, which I will do tomorrow.


### Day 35: February 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FCC Quote generator

**Thoughts:** Spent two hours making little "fancy" changes to the generator. I just discoved that if my quote contains a ";" it stops posting. I am going to try an figure out why that is later and if there is a way for me to fix that. I also have a slightly larger quote that contains some HTML <br /> in it that I want to not be included and need to see if there is a way around that.

### Day 36: February 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FCC Quote generator finished and more JQuery lessons

**Thoughts:** I was able to get my quote generator to a place that I was happy with it. I think that I could have put more quotes in there to cut down on the repeated quotes, but it should be okay. Everything works as far as I could tell. I might go back and add an if statement to make it pick another quote if it is the same one as the last one, but for now it works just fine.

### Day 37: February 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Start of weather page. Lots of research on geolocation

**Thoughts:** I didn't work on the layout of the page at all. Most of my time was spent looking at geolocation. I think I will use IP location to get the weather and avoid making the user approve the release of their location. Saves a step and will be able to start with the weather. Still a lot to go over before I attempt to get it into place.

### Day 38: February 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Weather page and research

**Thoughts:** I am trying to learn the things that I do not know that will be required for this weather app. I think I am going to have to go over JSON to get to what I need to  know. This kind of request on FCC is a little annoying since it does not tell you what stuff you will have needed to learn before you can accoplish the task. Tomorrow I think I will just study and learn what goes on with JSON.

### Day 39: February 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Back to the basics of JavaScript 

**Thoughts:** I Was going to try and jump into JSON today, but I figured there was still a lot I did not know when I left basic JavaScript and went into jQuery. I still like the simplicity of jQuery, but I think that it is important for me to know where jQuery is getting it's stuff. It will probably also serve me better to know at the very least the basics of JavaScript so that I am able to mix the two if necessary.

### Day 40: February 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Weather app and the link issue

**Thoughts:** I feel like todays progress line is the name of a chapter in a book. Anyways, I spent today trying to figure out why I am unable to concatenate some strings together. I am currently getting the lat and lon of the user, splitting it into an array of 2 string values, and trying to add them into a web address to get the weather info. For some reason when I am trying to concatenate them it makes the values undefined, but if I just call the values they are there and correct. I am not sure what I am missing on it. I will try and ask around tomorrow if anyone has any ideas on what is wrong.

### Day 41: February 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Half tinkering half javascrpt research 

**Thoughts:** I spent my first half hour tinkering with what is wrong in my code for plugging in the latitued and longitude into my URL. I think I figured that out, but now I am having issues getting it to get the weather info. Not sure what is going on with that. I spent the last half an hour reading more javascript from W3schools. It is helpful, but slow. I am going to try and just read up tomorrow in hopes of figuring out what is wrong with my code.

### Day 42: February 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript lessons and messing with a friends site

**Thoughts:** Split my time today because I was having a hard time focusing on the javascript lessons. I started learning about JS handling forms. A lot there that I did not know and also more that I learned about what HTML5 can do without JS. The other half an hour was spent disecting my friends site that he threw together on squarespace. https://www.thereasonsimbrokepod.com/ I started to see what I could do to recreate this in its current form. I think I might spend my whole hour on it tomorrow. 

### Day 43: February 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More site disections and a need to refocus my efforts

**Thoughts:** I feel like a kid with ADD. I am jumping all over the place and not finding a good structure to learn. I started off the day attempting to make a proper nav bar without the use of bootstrap because of some of the limits bootstrap has with it. I was able to make it happen, but was having issues getting it to center the bar instead of having it float left or right. I stopped work on that and went to codecademy to work on some of their javascript lessons. I think I might take a break for all this trial and error stuff to focus on those lessons for the next few days.

### Day 44: February 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts:**
