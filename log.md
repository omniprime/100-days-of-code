# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Free Code Camp lessons on HTML.

**Thoughts:** I have done all that I went through today before. I am feeling very anxious over getting back into this for some reason. I hope it goes away as I go on.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made it through the CSS and Bootstrap lessons. Just hit jQuery

**Thoughts:** I wish Bootstrap was a thing when I was doing this 10 years ago. I did not have as much anxiety today, but had a little trouble focusing. 

### Day 3: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the beginnings of jQuery in FCC. Started a codepen account to get some work done quickly on the web.

**Thoughts:** Code Pen is pretty nice. No need to worry about some of the things like the "<head>" and "<body>" since it is built in for you.

### Day 4: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished my Tribute page. Most of the delay came from researching my person, but this come with the territory when all info is not provided by the client. Will have it done tomorrow early so I can move on to other things.

**Thoughts:** This first project on FCC is simple enough. I got stuck for a good 10 minutes when I could not center my "<div>'s". realized that I forgot to add bootstrap to the CSS on Codepen.

### Day 5: January 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the tribute page. Took me the whole hour.

**Thoughts:** Didn't think this would take me the whole hour to do. Hopefully the next project will not require as much research. I am also a bit frustrated that codepen does not allow the target="_blank" option to go to a link. Makes me think that my code does not work.

### Day 6: January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on my portfolio page project for FCC. I focused solely on the top navbar portion of the page.

**Thoughts:** I think I should have stepped away from the navbar about halfway through my hour. I started to get a little overcome by how much I do not know about bootstrap and spent a lot of time trying to figure it all out. I will be spending some more time going over bootstrap and some simple Javascript to hopefully understand it better.

### Day 7: January 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I added the three required sections of the portfolio page and threw in some random placeholder images and colors. It looks like a clown page right now, but it is progress.

**Thoughts:** I am taking the day off tomorrow and I think I will spend most of the day learning more HTML, CSS, and about bootstrap. I am so far removed that most of my time for programming is taken up by research.

### Day 8: January 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished my portfolio page for the time being. I added the required buttons, links and placeholder spots for what I have worked on. 

**Thoughts:** I spent over 5 hours working and researching today to get the page as it looks. I think it still needs a lot of tweaks, but for now it will serve it's purpose and will give me a chance to move onto JavaScript.

### Day 9: January 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working my way through FCC's JavaScript lessions. So far mostly things I remember.

**Thoughts:** I forgot how much trouble Arrays gave me. I think there is something I am missing when I try to think about multi-dimentional arrays. When they start to get bigger I sometimes have a hard time keeping track. Perhaps tomorrows challenges will explain it better.

### Day 10: January 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent half of my hour learning more JavaScript. I spent the other half working on my personal CSS.

**Thoughts:** I am trying to replace Bootstrap to some degree so I know more about what is going on with my page than just having to guess how some of thier things interact. I still have a hard time with positioning. I have a header and a main body in good places, but my footer is floating at the top right now. Will work more on it tomorrow.

### Day 11: January 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent half of my hour learning more JavaScript. I spent the other half working on my personal CSS.

**Thoughts:** Splitting the JavaScript lessions might not be the best choice. I had to go back a rereference some things from yesterday. Not the worst thing in the world, but took time away. I spent about 45 minutes on more CSS work. I still am having issues positioning items. I look forward to my week off of work so I might be able to spend more time learning and testing.

### Day 12: January 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: All Javascrip lessons today. High anxiety night.

**Thoughts:** I made it through 12 lessons on Javascript tonight. I had a very hard time focusing on the coding. I know everything I did was correct and I understood what I was doing, but for some reason I was very distracted tonight. I might not count this as a day and repeat 12 tomorrow in hopes that my anxiety and focus are back to normal levels.

### Day 13: January 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started with CSS. Moved into Javascript lessons when ran into more positioning issues.

**Thoughts:** I am having a lot of trouble positioning things with CSS. I need to find an indepth guide to make more sense of it. I would think that if I set a <div> nested in another <div> to a certain % position it would remain there and resize when the page shrinks, but it does not always do that. When I got a bit frustrated with that I moved on to more Javascript lessons and made some good progress with objects. I do wish that FCC spent more time on CSS early than just having us rely on bootstrap.

### Day 14: January 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: All JavaScript lessons today. Got stuck on a search function

**Thoughts:** Good progress through loops. Ended the hour on the profile lookup lession. Having an issue visualizing how it needs to search through the object to find the items it is looking for. Will try again tomorrow.

### Day 15: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic section of JavaScript on FCC.

**Thoughts:** I got a little frustrated with the search through a profile section because I forgot about the hasOwnProperty function from a couple of days earlier. I think I might want to try and spend a little more time experimenting on some of these lessions to help retain more.

### Day 16: January 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent the who time messing with my portfolio page to try and get it to a better place.

**Thoughts:** I learned a few things about bootstraps positioning. I am not a huge fan of their color choices, but I can change that later. The hour kind of escaped me. I might change it to 2 hours when I am free coding like this.

### Day 17: January 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Another hour with the portfolio page and bootstrap

**Thoughts:** I am having trouble trying to center images of different heights next to each other. I am not sure what is causing it yet. I think it may be because they are in an <ul> and that is making it follow certain rules. I might try and change those out for something else.

### Day 18: January 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some JavaScript lessons on FCC. Started getting into the open ended questions to help me learn better. 

**Thoughts:** I broke my browser by forcing an infinite loop that I missed. Was kind of funny because I did not see why it was infinite at first. Realized my while statement could never finish because I kept raising the number I was trying to compair to. Got it fixed before the end of the hour. Overall felt kind of slow tonight because of some anxiety. 

### Day 19: January 21st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Palimdrones. whole hour to compair two strings.

**Thoughts:** Took longer than I thought it would to compair two strings. Mostly came down to the missing [ ] around my [^A-Za-z0-9] to remove any non alphanumerical characters. I think it is a little dumb that there isn't a shortcut way to do this. \W is close, but it includes the _ so it could not be used in this case. Reversing the string was not too hard once I stopped to think about it.

### Day 20: January 22nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on finding the longest word in a string.

**Thoughts:** For some reason I was not able to get this to work over the hour I had today. I kept getting an undefined error when I was trying to get the length of one of my words. I will look more at it tomorrow.

### Day 21: January 23rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a couple more basic JavaScript algorithms on FCC.

**Thoughts:** Really confused why setting a variable to anything but 0 would hurt my code so much. 

### Day 22: January 24th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on more CSS and getting my portfolio page to where I want it.

**Thoughts:** Learned a good deal about @media for CSS. It is a helpful call when your site needs to look different on different devices.

### Day 23: January 25th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Messed with a little more CSS then worked on another couple of FCC Javascript algorithms

**Thoughts:** I still have a lot to learn about CSS and JavaScript. I also think that a couple of the algorithm requests on the FCC lessons are meant for you to get wrong the first time.

### Day 24: January 26th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript algorithms

**Thoughts:** I over think almost every request that I am tasked with. I need to slow down and simply map out the problem instead of overcomplicating it.

### Day 25: January 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript algorithms

**Thoughts:** Three left to go. I am having issues with this seek and destroy alogrithm. I am not following how to properly cut up an object that could have infinite arguments.

### Day 26: January 28th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Seek and Destroy

**Thoughts:** This algorithm kicked my ass. I have learned that I am having a difficult time following a function inside of a function like that filter() expects. The last one was not as bad since Boolean is easier to follow, but having to make a simple function inside of the call will take some getting used to.

### Day 27: January 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Javascripting basic algorithms and intro to JSON

**Thoughts:** Finished up the basic algorithms on FCC. Moved onto the first lession of JSON APIs and Ajax. The final alogrithm was not too bad. I would like it to work for all characters and not just capitals, but that might be something for me to mess with later. It might be nice to have a simple cipher for future notes so not everyone can read my notes.

### Day 28: January 30th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Messed with CSS Flexbox and worked on some Codeacademy javascript lessons

**Thoughts:** I do not feel like I have the proper grasp on JavaScript. I am going to go through the lessons on Codeacademy to hopefully suplement the lessons I learned going through the stuff with FCC. I will probably do this for a couple of days to get a furth understanding of how Javascript effects web sites and not just the behind the scenes things that I had to do with the basic algorithms.

### Day 29: January 31st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent the hour on Codewars for JavaScript

**Thoughts:** I think I suck with Javascript. I need to find a place to research it and go one item at a time instead of getting a problem and having to spend so much time researching what I could possibly do to solve it. I am going to spend tomorrow on Codeacademy again I think and see is that helps.

### Day 30: February 1st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent the time working on JavaScript on Codeacademy and a little of codewars

**Thoughts:** CodeAcademy has some annoying syntax requirements that I do not care for. Code with case 'blah' : is the same as case 'blah': The extra space between the case and the colon makes no difference when running the code. A little annoying. The stuff I am currently doing is pretty basice again, but I think I need to do it to get better.

### Day 31: February 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some CSS and took a look at jQuery

**Thoughts:** I think I have a pretty good grasp on the basics of CSS. I just need to get into some futher manipulations that I think will come as I work with more javaScript. I deceided to take a look at jQuery today to see if that might help with some of the troubles I am having with main javascript. So far I wish I had done this sooner. It seems to be a lot easier to understand. I have only just scratched the surface of it, but I do wish that this was how javascript was originally designed.

### Day 32: February 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: jQuery animations and direct changes to CSS and HTML elements

**Thoughts:** Felt ill today. Only did 30 minutes of actual work. Going to make up the 30 minutes tomorrow when feeling better. Learned a good amount of basic jQuery and got a good understanding of selectors and chaining code.

### Day 33: February 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: jQuery, CSS, and Quote generation page

**Thoughts:** Made a ton of progress on the FCC Quote generator. I just have to make it look pretty now. Learned a ton about CSS flex and jQuery animations and changing HTML elements. Had a good 2 hours of it today. Didn't want to stop.

### Day 34: February 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FCC Quote generator

**Thoughts:** I spent the hour working on my quote generator. I was finally able to get the contents of the container to be centered using flexbox. It works pretty well. I will keep experimenting with it. The only thing I have left is to get it to post to Twitter, which I will do tomorrow.


### Day 35: February 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FCC Quote generator

**Thoughts:** Spent two hours making little "fancy" changes to the generator. I just discoved that if my quote contains a ";" it stops posting. I am going to try an figure out why that is later and if there is a way for me to fix that. I also have a slightly larger quote that contains some HTML <br /> in it that I want to not be included and need to see if there is a way around that.

### Day 36: February 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FCC Quote generator finished and more JQuery lessons

**Thoughts:** I was able to get my quote generator to a place that I was happy with it. I think that I could have put more quotes in there to cut down on the repeated quotes, but it should be okay. Everything works as far as I could tell. I might go back and add an if statement to make it pick another quote if it is the same one as the last one, but for now it works just fine.

### Day 37: February 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Start of weather page. Lots of research on geolocation

**Thoughts:** I didn't work on the layout of the page at all. Most of my time was spent looking at geolocation. I think I will use IP location to get the weather and avoid making the user approve the release of their location. Saves a step and will be able to start with the weather. Still a lot to go over before I attempt to get it into place.

### Day 38: February 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Weather page and research

**Thoughts:** I am trying to learn the things that I do not know that will be required for this weather app. I think I am going to have to go over JSON to get to what I need to  know. This kind of request on FCC is a little annoying since it does not tell you what stuff you will have needed to learn before you can accoplish the task. Tomorrow I think I will just study and learn what goes on with JSON.

### Day 39: February 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Back to the basics of JavaScript 

**Thoughts:** I Was going to try and jump into JSON today, but I figured there was still a lot I did not know when I left basic JavaScript and went into jQuery. I still like the simplicity of jQuery, but I think that it is important for me to know where jQuery is getting it's stuff. It will probably also serve me better to know at the very least the basics of JavaScript so that I am able to mix the two if necessary.
### Day 39: February 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Back to the basics of JavaScript 

**Thoughts:** I Was going to try and jump into JSON today, but I figured there was still a lot I did not know when I left basic JavaScript and went into jQuery. I still like the simplicity of jQuery, but I think that it is important for me to know where jQuery is getting it's stuff. It will probably also serve me better to know at the very least the basics of JavaScript so that I am able to mix the two if necessary.

### Day 40: February 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Weather app and the link issue

**Thoughts:** I feel like todays progress line is the name of a chapter in a book. Anyways, I spent today trying to figure out why I am unable to concatenate some strings together. I am currently getting the lat and lon of the user, splitting it into an array of 2 string values, and trying to add them into a web address to get the weather info. For some reason when I am trying to concatenate them it makes the values undefined, but if I just call the values they are there and correct. I am not sure what I am missing on it. I will try and ask around tomorrow if anyone has any ideas on what is wrong.

### Day 41: February 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Half tinkering half javascrpt research 

**Thoughts:** I spent my first half hour tinkering with what is wrong in my code for plugging in the latitued and longitude into my URL. I think I figured that out, but now I am having issues getting it to get the weather info. Not sure what is going on with that. I spent the last half an hour reading more javascript from W3schools. It is helpful, but slow. I am going to try and just read up tomorrow in hopes of figuring out what is wrong with my code.

### Day 42: February 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript lessons and messing with a friends site

**Thoughts:** Split my time today because I was having a hard time focusing on the javascript lessons. I started learning about JS handling forms. A lot there that I did not know and also more that I learned about what HTML5 can do without JS. The other half an hour was spent disecting my friends site that he threw together on squarespace. https://www.thereasonsimbrokepod.com/ I started to see what I could do to recreate this in its current form. I think I might spend my whole hour on it tomorrow. 

### Day 43: February 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More site disections and a need to refocus my efforts

**Thoughts:** I feel like a kid with ADD. I am jumping all over the place and not finding a good structure to learn. I started off the day attempting to make a proper nav bar without the use of bootstrap because of some of the limits bootstrap has with it. I was able to make it happen, but was having issues getting it to center the bar instead of having it float left or right. I stopped work on that and went to codecademy to work on some of their javascript lessons. I think I might take a break for all this trial and error stuff to focus on those lessons for the next few days.

### Day 44: February 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Codecademy lessons on functions and loops. Sticking with the basics in hopes to further understand the advanced stuff I found myself in.

**Thoughts:** The function stuff was a bit helpful as there were a few things in there that I overlooked the first time I went over them. Loops are still the same as they ever were. I love and hate them. They are helpful, but I still sometimes make a slight mistake to make them infinite. I think all it will take is doing it. I would love to find somewhere that has simple challenges for beginners to help them learn by doing more. I hope to get to more advanced things soon, but tomorrow will be their jQuery lessons.

### Day 45: February 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the JavaScript class on Codecademy. It was not too difficult. Going to move into jQuery tomorrow

**Thoughts:** I did not get too much new out of todays lesson. I do have a better understanding of $(this) and .next() and how they effect elements. I hope to learn a lot more in the jQuery class tomorrow.

### Day 46: February 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent the day on sololearn for CSS and did the first day of JavaScript30.

**Thoughts:** So far I am not too impressed with JS30. It was nice to see him do it, but I thought there was very little explanation of what was going on. It also seems like you have to know all of the things he was doing to fully grasp it. I am still very much a newbie when it comes to JS so I was a little lost on some of it. I will do at least another day or two worth to see if I get a better understanding of his teaching method.
  Also spent a good chunk of time on sololearn today. I am working my way through their CSS lesson so I have a better understanding of making pages look pretty. I think my biggest issue with that is that I am not a very creative person. I think as long as I am able to have someone draw up what they want it to look like and I can do things from there I will be good.
   
### Day 47: February 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent the hour on sololearn for more CSS and did the intro to jQuery on codecademy

**Thoughts:** Today was kind of a cheat day. Not much focus on the actual coding. I might double up on day 47 with whatever I am going over tomorrow. I just hope that I can reaquire my drive. I think the problem I am encountering right now is that I keep starting over because I get to a point in my lessons that I am not learning anything new from it or it ends with things I know so I jump to another thing.

### Day 48: February 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More jQuery on codecademy and messing with the CSS and content on the new portfolio page I am working on.

**Thoughts:** I still am not feeling like I am making much progress on what I work on each day. I might need to start waking up earlier to work on this for a different perspective. 
I think I have a good handle on the basics of jQuery now. I will continue to work through the codecademy course and I might work on some of it on sololearn when I get all the ins and outs of CSS under my belt. I think the biggest issue is my lack of creative brain keeping me down.

### Day 49: February 21st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Flexbox Froggy and more jQuery

**Thoughts:** Today felt like a good day. I learned about http://flexboxfroggy.com/ from another #100daysofcode coder and wanted to give it a shot. I was able to do all 24 challenges in about 20 minutes. Not too bad with my limited flexbox usage. I also learned a few things about positioning content ina flexbox. I think I will experiment with them some more. I also went through 2 more lessions ofjQuery on codecademy. I am starting to get into things I have not used too much, so I hope to start learning more about what each does and how to properly use them.

### Day 50: February 22nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent an early morning hour on jQuery on codecademy and making a simple list site

**Thoughts:** I had to stay home this morning to wait for a septic guy to pump the house. Figured it was a good time to start some coding. Went through a lesson on codecademy for jQuery, which taught how to add and remove items from a site on the fly. Figured I would mess with it some to make a simple list page. Spent about 20 minutes on that. Will complete another hour or so tonight after work and the kids are in bed.

### Day 51: February 23rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: A lot of jQuery lessons completed on codecademy and a just a touch of CSS on sololearn

**Thoughts:** I understand all that jQuery is doing so far. I think most of the help I will get from this will be from trial and error and lot and lots of repetition. Was a hard focus day, but I made it through. I need to get my motivation up. I can do this!

### Day 52: February 24th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Codecademy course on jQuery and almost finished the CSS fundamentals on Sololearn

**Thoughts:** Codecademy gave me a good foundation for my knowledge of jQuery. I will have to start coming up with things to test my knowledge of it and sharpen my skills. I spent the rest of my time in CSS fundamentals on SoloLearn. I enjoy that program and hope to continue it when I am done with CSS.

### Day 53: February 25th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent the day playing with CSS and jQuery trying to make a page that will start with one <div> shown, but when different buttons are pressed it will hide the current <div> and show the selected one.

**Thoughts:** I built the structure for the site and got all of that implemented properly, but could not figure out the best way to incorporate the jQuery or JavaScript to make it do what I wanted. I think part of my issues was that I was trying to use a slideToggle() in my if statement and I would be best to just do a show for now. Not 100% sure how I will get it to work, but will try again tomorrow.

### Day 54: February 26th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent all of my time sprucing up my new page and a good 20 minutes until I realized that I forgot a . in my CSS class declaration.

**Thoughts:** I am making good progress on my new portfolio page, but made the mistake to take a look at some other pages and realize how much I do not know yet. It was a little discouraging, but I am going to work through it. Tomorrow I think I will finish adding my content to the page and replace the one I have one codepen. I will then go back to my weather app in hopes that I have learned enough to get through the issues I was having with it.

### Day 55: February 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on my portfolio gallery with jQuery and CSS. Was able to make the thumbnails clickable to change the larger image to the click thumbnail. Also have it so the user can click the larger image to go to a website for the image (if available)

**Thoughts:** I feel like I am making good progress on my new portfolio site. It will need more colors, but it is coming alone nicely. I like how there is no scrolling required now. Tomorrow I will probably have to get it online to test to see how it looks on a phone or other small device. Feeling good about it so far.

### Day 56: February 28th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the gallery page and changed it so that if there is a link for the image the link will be available, but if not it will only target the current page. Also added <form> elements to my contact page.

**Thoughts:** Semi-happy with my gallery. It works the way I wanted it to. I might tweak it again in the future. I started my contact page, but not happy with my formatting so far. I will mess with it more tomorrow. 

### Day 57: March 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Have the basics of my contact page done. Just need or add my icons for github, codepen, and the like.

**Thoughts:** I am not 100% satisfied with the way my inputs look on my contact page, and all of the pages need more color. I also need to remember to remove the border and color from my header. I might add a small footer to make it look a little uniform. I also started a 000webhost account so I could host some of this off of codepen. Codepen was giving me an issue where it was not showing all of my header. Not sure what was causing it, but it looks fine on the 000webhost. The URL is https://cmportfolio.000webhostapp.com/index.html It will still need some changes, but I like where it is now comapired to where my first one was.

### Day 58: March 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: finished my new portfolio and went back to the weather page.

**Thoughts:** I spent the majority of my time doing research on how to properly call the weather api. I must be doing something wrong with my call since I am not getting it to pull any of the weather info. I might be missing something when it comes to JSON, so I might look into that more tomorrow.

### Day 59: March 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JSON. I'm just not getting you.

**Thoughts:** I am not sure what I am doing wrong. I have tried to get my weather data with javascript and with jquery. No luck. I am not sure what I am missing. I am not having good luck with it tonight, so I will step back and try again tomorrow.

### Day 60: March 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Weather App progress was made. Finally was able to get the data to load.

**Thoughts:** Not sure what my issue was, but I was able to get the data to load. It is a little slower than I would like so I think I am going to have to figure out a way to get the info before it draws the page. Still thrilled I was able to finally get it to display the info I needed. I do find it a little odd that the OpenWeatherMap uses an array for the current weather but objects for everything else. Once again I am happy that I used the console to figure out a few things. It has to become a habbit for me in the future.

### Day 61: March 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Messed with CSS to try and draw a sun until I realized that Openweathermap has icons provided. Wrote a line to link in the current icon.

**Thoughts:** Made only a little progress on the app today. I spent too much time playing with CSS to try and draw a sun. I got it mostly drawn, but realized I would have a lot more to do after that. I then realized that there were icons provided. Tomorrow I will spruce up the look of things to finish the project.

### Day 62: March 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the weather app. added the convert temp and changed the mouse to a pointer when hovering over the temperature element. (http://codepen.io/omniprime/full/zZKYOL/)

**Thoughts:**  My code it probably a little sloppy, but it does what it is supposed to. I might go back to it later to try and clean it up and shorten it where I can. I just don't know enough about javascript to know where I can cut or combine things. The Wikipedia app is next. This one does not seem to be as hard as the last, but I should probably add a bit more flare to it compaired to my weather app 

### Day 63: March 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: The basic layout of the wikipedia page for FCC is done. Made the search <input> pulse as a circle until focused. Reverts when blured and goes back to pulsing.

**Thoughts:**  Took a little longer than I thought it would to make that simple animation. I am still very unpracticed. A long way to go to get where I do not need to look things up constantly. Happy with the progress, but I need to dedicate more time to this so I can grow more.

### Day 64: March 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Some jQuery youtube lessons and got the look of my Wikipedia viewer page done. 

**Thoughts:**  So far, I am a bit overwhelmed by the MediaWiki API. There is a lot in there that I just do not understand yet. So much of my knowledge has been quick research and not enough step by step growth. I am going to try and spend some time reading the tutorial tomorrow to get a better grasp of what I will need to do to pull the search info I need for the viewer page. Hoping to have a breakthrough with this one by the end of the weekend. Just need to focus.

### Day 65: March 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not much in the way of progress today. A couple of jQuery tutorial videos and setting up my testing site.

**Thoughts:**  Not a good focusing day. Did some more video tutorials and had some good understanding. I just need to make some use of them in the near future. Having some trouble focusing today. Feeling very drained. Have a ton on my plate tomorrow, so I may have to skip it.

### Day 66: March 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made some progress on submitting forms to only javascript instead of a file and was able to get the array for 10 search results from Wikipedia.

**Thoughts:**  Not 100% happy with my progress today. I was able to get the array of info from wikipedia, but did not test anything with it. I spent a lot longer than I should have figuring out the simply way to get form data without submitting it to another file. I might dive back in later today to see about making some further progress on it and trim up my code a bit.

### Day 67: March 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: ZERO progress made. Having big issues with figuring out callbacks. I just am having a hard time grasping it.

**Thoughts:**  Ending this session very upset with myself. Spent 2 hours attempting to figure out what I am missing and I can not find it. I think I might start over from scratch on my JS tomorrow and see if that will get me anywhere. Not feeling it tonight. I also still suck at asking for help on what I am doing wrong.

### Day 68: March 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: It wasn't the callback it was the form submission. Figured out that my .submit() or .on("submit", function()) were causing the issue, because my callback was not canceling the normal submission of the form and would delete my info on the page.

**Thoughts:**  Only took most of the hour, but glad I figured it out. Have it pulling the data I need. Tomorrow will be spent formatting it properly and making it show only when I need it. Hopefully I will finish tomorrow. Progress!

### Day 69: March 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got the basics down for the look of the results. I am having an issue where my links are not for the whole div just the text.

**Thoughts:**  Made a lot of good progress and cleaned up some of my javascript when I realized that my code was getting a little out of hand. Made a for loop to make divs based on what my results return. Looks ok on the page, but I still have a little ways to go to finish. Spent nearly 2.5 hours today.

### Day 70: March 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the wiki site. It searches and displays the results. 

**Thoughts:**  Don't like the way it looks. I could turn it in, but I do not like how some of it looks. I don't like the fact that I don't have it clear the results if it is asked to. I don't like how it refreshes when it does a new search when old data is already displayed. I will probably play with it a bit more tomorrow and turn it in.

### Day 71: March 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Wikipedia Viewer and looked at what will be required for the Twitch API. 

**Thoughts:**  I am overly critical of my work and am not impressed by what I have done. I don't think that it looks great, but it does what is required of it. The more I work on the front end of things, the more I think I might be better off on the back end. I am able to make my code work, but making it look good seems to take a lot longer than I think it should. Probably more repetition will help with that.

### Day 72: March 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some research on jQuery .get() and tried to apply it to my recent wiki and weather apps with little success. I also took a short crash course on git, also did not understand or absorb it all.

**Thoughts:**  Had to skip yesterday because was out with the family and forgot to pack the laptop. It was probably for the best, because I do not think I would have had the time to commit to a full hour. Spent today messing with .get() and a little git. I have a stange feeling I am going to have a lot of reading ahead of me to fully understand what is going on with different get commands. I kept getting a "Cross-Origin Request Blocked" or something similar when I made a request that wasn't jsonp. I will try to figure it out more tomorrow. I think it will be in my best interest to try and makes some connections with others to help me understand what is going on.
I also took a look at git to see if that might be worth my effort to attempt. I am not sure it will at the moment since I do not have anyone I am working with or even regularly converse with regarding code. I might put this on a back burner until a time comes that I will really need it. I have a basic understanding of github, so I figure that will suit my needs for the time being.

### Day 73: March 22nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent the whole time going through SoloLearn JS course. 3/4 complete in the hour

**Thoughts:**  I did not have any drive today. Spent the hour on SoloLearn instead of direct coding. Kind of in a stupor. Hope to clear out of it soon so I can focus on this again. Thought I was making good progress before this past weekend.

### Day 74: March 24th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did the basic layout for the Twitch stream viewer. Spent the last 10 minutes doing some more sololearn JS.

**Thoughts:**  I am a little confused and frustrated on why my pages look different on chrome vs firefox. I use firefox as my main browser and just started opening my pages in chrome. For some reason chrome does not like to flexbox, because it looks good on firefox, but even with the -webkit- additions it does not work quite right. I will try to read up on it more tomorrow to make sure I am doing it correctly.

### Day 75: March 25th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some SoloLearn JS class tonight

**Thoughts:**  Wasn't feeling to motivated. Just did a little Sololearn. Almost done with the JS section, just one more section to go. The more I do this the more I think these online learning tools are not great. They are good to get some basic understanding, but I think actually doing the coding is what will help me in the long run. 

### Day 76: March 26th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Small progress made on the Twitch Stream API.

**Thoughts:**  Got the call to go out for the status of the streams. It does not look like the calls are going out in order though. I will have to look closer at it tomorrow. Going to mess with it some more tomorrow. I seem to have the $.get jsonp requests down. I just have to figure out the other $.get calls and make them work.

### Day 77: March 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More work on the Twitch API. Made the for loop go through my array or provided channels to check if they are online. appends a new <div> to my container with the results.

**Thoughts:**  I am able to get the online accounts to show up properly, but I am having an issue with the offline ones. It will make a new <div> for all of the offline ones, but the name is not correct as my .get is returning after the loop is done. I need to figure out a way to make it wait for each get call to finish. I attempted a .wait().done() but the problem is that it needs to run the get call twice for some reason. I am not sure why. I get responses like this the first time it runs  [HTTP/2.0 301 Moved Permanently 197ms]. I will look more into it tomorrow.

### Day 78: March 30th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Was able to get some work done tonight. Worked on the Twitch API and have the functions mostly working. 

**Thoughts:**  It pulls the data from twitch and puts online items at the top and offline items underneath. Tomorrow I need to have it hide the offline or online items when asked. I also have an issue where I am not getting an error when a channel does not exist. I am not sure why. I will try and chat with people about it tomorrow.

### Day 79: March 31st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Twitch API With no progress 

**Thoughts:**  All I did was try to produce an error. I am not getting one. More frustrated than ever with this page. I am very close to attempting to see what I am doing wrong through the FCC JS. 

### Day 80: April 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Twitch API with all the progress. Got all the crap to work.

**Thoughts:**  I still can not get it to produce an undefined response from the streams, but I formatted it for it anyways redundantly. It now pulls all my proper info and fills it into the proper <div> (onlines, offlines, and errors). I think this will save some time for reordering them. Tomorrow I will spend my time making it look good and allow the onlines and offlines to be hidden and shown when links are clicked. Progress!!

### Day 81: April 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Twitch API CSS and layout work.

**Thoughts:**  I am going too far away from the required user stories. I spent a good amount of my time adding the stream to the page if it was online. I stopped before I got it completed because I realized that I was not doing what I should. I am going to just finish the formatting tomorrow and turn it in. Later I will go back and add the stream stuff to the page for on site video.

### Day 88: April 5th and 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Twitch API CSS and layout work.

**Thoughts:**  Turned in my twitch API. Not happy with the colors, but I have very little in the way of an artistic eye. It works though and that is what matters most. I might have to switch to back end development soon in an attempt to do something that does not require art and is more logic based. 

### Day 89: April 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenge 1

**Thoughts:**  I always have one little mistake in each of my codes. It took me the hour to realize I had a manual starting place on my reduce function. I felt kind of dumb. Got it working though and know what I did wrong and how it works. I'll take that as a win.

### Day 90: April 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenge 2 and 3

**Thoughts:**  Worked a little faster today. I was able to get through 2 algorithms today instead of just one. I am having a little more trouble than I thought when it comes to properly mapping out how I am going to solve the problem. I think the next one I am going to try and avoid any online searching and just go straight from memory. I am not sure how well that will work, but here's hoping.

### Day 91: April 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenge Wherefore art thou

**Thoughts:**  Having some trouble with my code for this one. I am attempting to loop through the array with a for in loop and check for the property with the hasOwnProperty() method. I am getting it to return [object, Object] but not the actual object at the moment. I am missing something or have an Object.keys() check in the wrong place. I will pick it up again tomorrow.
