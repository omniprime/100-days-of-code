# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Free Code Camp lessons on HTML.

**Thoughts:** I have done all that I went through today before. I am feeling very anxious over getting back into this for some reason. I hope it goes away as I go on.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made it through the CSS and Bootstrap lessons. Just hit jQuery

**Thoughts:** I wish Bootstrap was a thing when I was doing this 10 years ago. I did not have as much anxiety today, but had a little trouble focusing. 

### Day 3: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the beginnings of jQuery in FCC. Started a codepen account to get some work done quickly on the web.

**Thoughts:** Code Pen is pretty nice. No need to worry about some of the things like the "<head>" and "<body>" since it is built in for you.

### Day 4: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished my Tribute page. Most of the delay came from researching my person, but this come with the territory when all info is not provided by the client. Will have it done tomorrow early so I can move on to other things.

**Thoughts:** This first project on FCC is simple enough. I got stuck for a good 10 minutes when I could not center my "<div>'s". realized that I forgot to add bootstrap to the CSS on Codepen.

### Day 5: January 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the tribute page. Took me the whole hour.

**Thoughts:** Didn't think this would take me the whole hour to do. Hopefully the next project will not require as much research. I am also a bit frustrated that codepen does not allow the target="_blank" option to go to a link. Makes me think that my code does not work.

### Day 6: January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on my portfolio page project for FCC. I focused solely on the top navbar portion of the page.

**Thoughts:** I think I should have stepped away from the navbar about halfway through my hour. I started to get a little overcome by how much I do not know about bootstrap and spent a lot of time trying to figure it all out. I will be spending some more time going over bootstrap and some simple Javascript to hopefully understand it better.

### Day 7: January 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I added the three required sections of the portfolio page and threw in some random placeholder images and colors. It looks like a clown page right now, but it is progress.

**Thoughts:** I am taking the day off tomorrow and I think I will spend most of the day learning more HTML, CSS, and about bootstrap. I am so far removed that most of my time for programming is taken up by research.

### Day 8: January 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished my portfolio page for the time being. I added the required buttons, links and placeholder spots for what I have worked on. 

**Thoughts:** I spent over 5 hours working and researching today to get the page as it looks. I think it still needs a lot of tweaks, but for now it will serve it's purpose and will give me a chance to move onto JavaScript.

### Day 9: January 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working my way through FCC's JavaScript lessions. So far mostly things I remember.

**Thoughts:** I forgot how much trouble Arrays gave me. I think there is something I am missing when I try to think about multi-dimentional arrays. When they start to get bigger I sometimes have a hard time keeping track. Perhaps tomorrows challenges will explain it better.

### Day 10: January 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent half of my hour learning more JavaScript. I spent the other half working on my personal CSS.

**Thoughts:** I am trying to replace Bootstrap to some degree so I know more about what is going on with my page than just having to guess how some of thier things interact. I still have a hard time with positioning. I have a header and a main body in good places, but my footer is floating at the top right now. Will work more on it tomorrow.
