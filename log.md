# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Free Code Camp lessons on HTML.

**Thoughts:** I have done all that I went through today before. I am feeling very anxious over getting back into this for some reason. I hope it goes away as I go on.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made it through the CSS and Bootstrap lessons. Just hit jQuery

**Thoughts:** I wish Bootstrap was a thing when I was doing this 10 years ago. I did not have as much anxiety today, but had a little trouble focusing. 

### Day 3: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the beginnings of jQuery in FCC. Started a codepen account to get some work done quickly on the web.

**Thoughts:** Code Pen is pretty nice. No need to worry about some of the things like the "<head>" and "<body>" since it is built in for you.

### Day 4: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished my Tribute page. Most of the delay came from researching my person, but this come with the territory when all info is not provided by the client. Will have it done tomorrow early so I can move on to other things.

**Thoughts:** This first project on FCC is simple enough. I got stuck for a good 10 minutes when I could not center my "<div>'s". realized that I forgot to add bootstrap to the CSS on Codepen.

### Day 5: January 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the tribute page. Took me the whole hour.

**Thoughts:** Didn't think this would take me the whole hour to do. Hopefully the next project will not require as much research. I am also a bit frustrated that codepen does not allow the target="_blank" option to go to a link. Makes me think that my code does not work.

### Day 6: January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on my portfolio page project for FCC. I focused solely on the top navbar portion of the page.

**Thoughts:** I think I should have stepped away from the navbar about halfway through my hour. I started to get a little overcome by how much I do not know about bootstrap and spent a lot of time trying to figure it all out. I will be spending some more time going over bootstrap and some simple Javascript to hopefully understand it better.

### Day 7: January 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I added the three required sections of the portfolio page and threw in some random placeholder images and colors. It looks like a clown page right now, but it is progress.

**Thoughts:** I am taking the day off tomorrow and I think I will spend most of the day learning more HTML, CSS, and about bootstrap. I am so far removed that most of my time for programming is taken up by research.

### Day 8: January 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished my portfolio page for the time being. I added the required buttons, links and placeholder spots for what I have worked on. 

**Thoughts:** I spent over 5 hours working and researching today to get the page as it looks. I think it still needs a lot of tweaks, but for now it will serve it's purpose and will give me a chance to move onto JavaScript.

### Day 9: January 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working my way through FCC's JavaScript lessions. So far mostly things I remember.

**Thoughts:** I forgot how much trouble Arrays gave me. I think there is something I am missing when I try to think about multi-dimentional arrays. When they start to get bigger I sometimes have a hard time keeping track. Perhaps tomorrows challenges will explain it better.

### Day 10: January 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent half of my hour learning more JavaScript. I spent the other half working on my personal CSS.

**Thoughts:** I am trying to replace Bootstrap to some degree so I know more about what is going on with my page than just having to guess how some of thier things interact. I still have a hard time with positioning. I have a header and a main body in good places, but my footer is floating at the top right now. Will work more on it tomorrow.

### Day 11: January 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent half of my hour learning more JavaScript. I spent the other half working on my personal CSS.

**Thoughts:** Splitting the JavaScript lessions might not be the best choice. I had to go back a rereference some things from yesterday. Not the worst thing in the world, but took time away. I spent about 45 minutes on more CSS work. I still am having issues positioning items. I look forward to my week off of work so I might be able to spend more time learning and testing.

### Day 12: January 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: All Javascrip lessons today. High anxiety night.

**Thoughts:** I made it through 12 lessons on Javascript tonight. I had a very hard time focusing on the coding. I know everything I did was correct and I understood what I was doing, but for some reason I was very distracted tonight. I might not count this as a day and repeat 12 tomorrow in hopes that my anxiety and focus are back to normal levels.

### Day 13: January 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started with CSS. Moved into Javascript lessons when ran into more positioning issues.

**Thoughts:** I am having a lot of trouble positioning things with CSS. I need to find an indepth guide to make more sense of it. I would think that if I set a <div> nested in another <div> to a certain % position it would remain there and resize when the page shrinks, but it does not always do that. When I got a bit frustrated with that I moved on to more Javascript lessons and made some good progress with objects. I do wish that FCC spent more time on CSS early than just having us rely on bootstrap.

### Day 14: January 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: All JavaScript lessons today. Got stuck on a search function

**Thoughts:** Good progress through loops. Ended the hour on the profile lookup lession. Having an issue visualizing how it needs to search through the object to find the items it is looking for. Will try again tomorrow.

### Day 15: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic section of JavaScript on FCC.

**Thoughts:** I got a little frustrated with the search through a profile section because I forgot about the hasOwnProperty function from a couple of days earlier. I think I might want to try and spend a little more time experimenting on some of these lessions to help retain more.

### Day 16: January 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent the who time messing with my portfolio page to try and get it to a better place.

**Thoughts:** I learned a few things about bootstraps positioning. I am not a huge fan of their color choices, but I can change that later. The hour kind of escaped me. I might change it to 2 hours when I am free coding like this.

### Day 17: January 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Another hour with the portfolio page and bootstrap

**Thoughts:** I am having trouble trying to center images of different heights next to each other. I am not sure what is causing it yet. I think it may be because they are in an <ul> and that is making it follow certain rules. I might try and change those out for something else.

### Day 18: January 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some JavaScript lessons on FCC. Started getting into the open ended questions to help me learn better. 

**Thoughts:** I broke my browser by forcing an infinite loop that I missed. Was kind of funny because I did not see why it was infinite at first. Realized my while statement could never finish because I kept raising the number I was trying to compair to. Got it fixed before the end of the hour. Overall felt kind of slow tonight because of some anxiety. 

### Day 19: January 21st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Palimdrones. whole hour to compair two strings.

**Thoughts:** Took longer than I thought it would to compair two strings. Mostly came down to the missing [ ] around my [^A-Za-z0-9] to remove any non alphanumerical characters. I think it is a little dumb that there isn't a shortcut way to do this. \W is close, but it includes the _ so it could not be used in this case. Reversing the string was not too hard once I stopped to think about it.
